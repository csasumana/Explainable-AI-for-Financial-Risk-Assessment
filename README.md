# Explainable-AI-for-Financial-Risk-Assessment


• Developed a financial risk assessment model using Gradient Boosting to predict loan defaults, achieving a ROC-AUC score of 0.75

• Enhanced model performance through creation of domain-specific features like credit utilization ratio and payment behavior patterns

• Applied Principal Component Analysis and Recursive Feature Elimination for dimensionality reduction, enhancing model accuracy

• Applied SHAP and LIME techniques to improve model interpretability, boosting non-technical stakeholder trust in AI decisions

• Developed interactive dashboards using Plotly and Dash, enabling stakeholders to explore model outputs and gain insights of credit risk
